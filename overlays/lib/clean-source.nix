## Functions for cleaning local source directories. These are useful
## for filtering out files in your local repo that should not
## contribute to a Nix hash, so that you can just `src = ./.` in
## your derivation, and then filter that attribute after the fact.
##
## Note that these functions are composable, e.g., cleanSourceNix
## (cleanCabalStack ...) is a valid expression. They will also
## compose with any `lib.cleanSourceWith` function (but *not* with
## `builtins.filterSource`; see the `lib.cleanSourceWith`
## documentation).

  # In most cases, I believe that filtering Nix files from the source
  # hash is the right thing to do. They're obviously already evaluated
  # when a nix-build command is executed, so if *what they evaluate*
  # changes they'll cause a rebuild anyway, as they should; while
  # cosmetic changes (comments, formatting, etc.) won't.
